# Add Funds Clarity Smart Contract

This repository hosts the `addFunds.clar` smart contract, written in Clarity. The contract is designed to manage account balances within a blockchain application. It features a key-value map to store account balances and a public function `add-funds` that enables adding funds to specified accounts. If an account does not exist, it is initialized with the deposit amount; otherwise, the deposit is added to the current balance.

## Prerequisites

To work with this Clarity smart contract, you will need:

- Access to a Stacks blockchain node or a Clarity development environment such as Clarinet.
- Basic understanding of Clarity smart contract language and deployment processes.

## Installation

First, clone this repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/Marqui-13/simpleClaritySmartContract.git


Ensure you have Clarinet installed or access to a Stacks node for testing and deployment.

## Usage

### Testing Locally

If you are using Clarinet, navigate to the project directory and run:


clarinet console


Within the Clarinet console, you can interact with the contract by calling the `add-funds` function:


(contract-call? .addFunds add-funds 1 100)


This example command attempts to add 100 units of the native token to the account with ID 1.

### Deployment

To deploy this contract to a live Stacks blockchain, follow the official [Stacks deployment instructions](https://docs.stacks.co/write-smart-contracts/deploy).

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the contract or extend its functionality are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
